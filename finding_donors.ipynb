    "### (Kaggle/Udacity) Competition Description\n",
    "CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. \n",
    "With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent. <br>\n",

    "In this project, I will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "My goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. The data I have investigated here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.\n"

    "### Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real World Application:\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensamble learner which consists of numerious decision Trees that are used collectively to perform classification tasks. They can be used in banks for determining whether a possible client is a viable candidate to receive a credit card and has a strong likelihood to fulfill his credit dues in comparison to a possible defaulter or an individual who is more likely to not pay dues. A decision tree classifier can be used based on past data which used various characteristics (i.e. Demographics, financial status, etc.) to determine the likelihood of the candidate being “credit worthy” or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://knowyourdata.be/2016/02/08/decision-trees-in-banking-industry-creditworthiness/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths: \n",
    "1.\tEasy and simple to understand and interpret.\n",
    "2. Can be used for both classification and regression tasks. \n",
    "3.\tThey perform well on categorical data (i.e. yes/no decisions, classifications according to gender, race etc.);\n",
    "\n",
    "https://medium.com/@Synced/how-random-forest-algorithm-works-in-machine-learning-3c0fe15b6674\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weakness:\n",
    "1.\tThey do not follow a standard meaning there is no one “right” decision tree/random forest(s) for the same data and their can be numerous variations of the decision tree;\n",
    "2.\tA small change in variables/data can produce large changes in the forest.\n",
    "3.\tThey perform poorly and do not work on continuous variables which make them unfit for regression based supervised learning.\n",

    "Decision Trees are good models for Charity ML because Charity ML consists of numerous categorical variables such as “workclass”, “education level”, “marital status”, “relationship”, “race” and “sex”. The Decision tree can work rapidly on these categorical variables to determine the outcome of class variable (income). \n",

    "2.\tCan work with less training data.\n",
    "3.\tCan handle both continuous and discrete data\n",
    "4.\tWorks well when independent assumptions are needed where one variable needs to be independently assessed without considering any correlation with another variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantage:\n",
    "1.\tPerforms poorly when independent assumptions are not needed where one variable needs to be assessed considering correlation with another variable. Hence it is called a “naïve” predictor\n",
    "2.\tWorking with small training data means greater tendency to overfit towards data occurring more frequently, can also have lower precision and recall. \n",

    "The Random Forest classifier is like a collection of numerious Decision trees bundled together so that a collective higher accuracy and F-Score is achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is like that of a typical Yes/No classification graph. Where the individual decides on a set of rules in order to classify data or predict outcomes. For example if Charity ML wants to decide what day is best suited for them to host a fundraiser given the dates of the entire year. They can start by a general rules of \n",
    "1. Those days which are holidays and which are not;\n",
    "The tree can further be iterativly divided into Yes/No branches to find the optimal result. The further branches can be:\n",
    "2. Of the days which are holidays, how many of them are family holidays(christmas, easter, Eid) so that maximum people can come.\n",
    "3. Of these family holidays, how many of them fall at the beginning of the fiscal year? \n",
    "And it can iteratively go on and on untill the optimal result is achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "These decisions can applied in many ways and combinations therefore many different \"trees\" can be formed. So a collection of these \"trees\" are known as a Random Forest and a combination of them allow us to achieving a higher accuracy and F-Score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decsion tree is also very self explainatory where the rules can easily be understood without technical knowledge, it is also very intuitive and works well on classificaiton tasks like that of Charity ML. The best part of using a combination of decision trees is that it wouldn't overfit, meaning that the this learner won't \"memorize\" your data rather it would intuitively learn from them. \n",
